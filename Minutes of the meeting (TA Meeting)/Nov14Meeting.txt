Today we showed how far developed we are in our website and with what we have so far.
We asked how developed it needs to be and he gave us some ideas to add such as like a Tinder for dating 
or some social media aspect. We talked about challenges and things that are going well.
We think that this week has been one of the best weeks that we have had so far in terms of challenges.
